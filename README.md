# The best Alfred Workflow for Converting Currencies. Period.

## Prerequisites

This workflow relies on currencyconverterapi.com. You will need to obtain an API key, which is available entirely free of charge at <https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/free-api-key>. (The free version is limited to 100 requests/hour, enough for most of us).

## Preferences

Preferences are Alfred Workflow Environment Variables, which can be set / changed in the Alfred Preferences.

Name | | Values
------------|---|-------
lb_freecurrencyconverter_api_key | required | API key for the **free** version of the currencyconverter.api
lb_language | optional | possible values *en* (default) or *de*, only affects decimal point (*en* = `.` / *de* = `,`) and thousands seperator (*en* = `,` / *de* = `.`)

This workflow was heavily inspired and is based on the source code of bigluck’s (aka Luca Bigon) original Alfred Currency Converter <https://github.com/bigluck/alfred2-currencyconverter>. Released with Luca’s permission.
